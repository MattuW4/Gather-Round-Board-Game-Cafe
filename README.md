The latter have been developed to be responsive for smaller devices with the home page tabe disappearing to accommodate a balanced display.

- F01 Landing page and hero image

There is a hero image on the landing page that welcomes the user and clearly states the cafe name. The image has been chosen to draw the user in to a shared experience that they might be seeking and identify with. There is easily accessible information on the cafe, the opening times (in a table) and location with an embeded google maps link. A button internally links the user directly to the booking page as the site intends to provide information to make an informed decision, that decision being for a user to commit their custom and book.
