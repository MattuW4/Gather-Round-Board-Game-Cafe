The site has been designed to work through the anticipated ranking of need and desires of users from first time visitors to regular users, recognising needs and wants differ.

- F01 Navigation bar

The navigation bar is consistent across all pages, being easy to recognise, find and use. It has a logo to the left that takes the user to the homepage and a simple menu, game library and booking link to the right. The latter have been developed to be responsive for smaller devices with the home page tabe disappearing to accommodate a balanced display.

- F02, F03, F04, F05, F06 Landing page and hero image

There is a hero image on the landing page that welcomes the user and clearly states the cafe name. The image has been chosen to draw the user in to a shared experience that they might be seeking and identify with. There is easily accessible information on the cafe, the opening times (in a table) and location with an embeded google maps link. A button internally links the user directly to the booking page as the site intends to provide information to make an informed decision, that decision being for a user to commit their custom and book.

- F08, F09 Games and Events page

This page provides an overview of some games that the cafe offers. The images are styled to draw the user in whilst providing easily accessible information for them to make a decision. These image columns are responsively styled on smaller devices. There is a booking button again that encourages the user to book based on the games that they have seen and make this easy to achieve. The events section is also responsively designed to scale to fit smaller devices. The intention of this section is to again inform the user about what is going on, empowering them to make a decision about joining the social element of the cafe whilst also informing about particular game formats that they may be interested or engaged in.

- F10, F11, F12 Booking and menu hero image, booking form and menu table

The hero image here has been chosen to evoke the social experience that would excite the user and encourage them to book  making an emotional connection. The form has been developed and is a destination from acros the site by internal links. The form requires the user to enter information in all sections but also provides the option to reset at any point. This form is responsively designed to scale down to smaller devices. To accompany the booking form and increase likelihood of a user committing to a longer period of time at the cafe the simple food and drinks menu is below which is also responsively designed. Whilst this information is important it is prioritised lowest in terms of feature prominence because it is anticipated that users would want higher ranking information in the first instance i.e. opening times, locaction, booking options, games and events.
